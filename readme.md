Welcome to the visual bathtub!

1. Run "npm install" or "yarn" to install the packages.
2. Type "npm run start" or "yarn start" to start front-end.

This project allows the ability to click two buttons. Once the buttons are clicked the water levels will increase by 1 every two seconds up to 5 levels of water or decrease every 2 seconds to 0 levels of water. 

As the water level increases or decreases you can click the buttons and it will respond after 2 seconds.

Thank you for playing around with the application!
